# 🗂️ Mass Renamer 2.2

**Mass Renamer** is a Linux application developed in Python with a `Qt6` interface, which allows you to rename multiple files quickly, safely, and in an organized manner. It supports undoing the most recent renaming even if the app was closed or crashed, adding extensions to filenames, protection from accidental file or folder overscription and a multilingual interface (🇧🇷 Portuguese and 🇺🇸 English).

**Download:** [**Releases**](https://github.com/JediFonseca/mass_renamer/releases)

**Tested on:**
- Fedora 42 (GNOME);
- Debian 13 (MATE);
- Linux Mint 22.2 (Cinnamon);
- Ubuntu 22.04;
- Ubuntu 24.04;
- Ubuntu 25.04.


**IMPORTANT:** This software was created for **recreational and experimental purposes**. It is being made available as **free** and **open-source**. If it helps you in any way, make good use of it. Feel free to contribute, adapt, or share! I am not a developer, I don't work in the field, and I don't have in-depth knowledge of any programming language. The development of this software was done **for fun and as a hobby** with the **assistance of AI** (**Vibe Coding**).

### 🚀 Installation and usage

Mass Renamer is made available in AppImage, which can run, theoretically, on any Linux distro.
On Ubuntu you may need to install the `libfuse2t64` package:
```
sudo apt install libfuse2t64
```
1. Run the ".appimage".
2. Select the folder where the files to be renamed are located.
3. Click "Load names" to load the names of all files in the selected folder or enter the original names manually in the "Original names" field.
4. Enter the new names in the "New names" field.
5. Click on "Rename files".

NOTE: The file whose original name is on line "1" of the "Original names" field will be renamed to the name that is on line "1" of the "New names" field, and so on.
