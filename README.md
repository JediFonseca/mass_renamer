## ⚠️ Personal Project

Mass Renamer was built for my own personal use. The repository is public and anyone is welcome to use, fork, or modify it freely. That said, since this is a hobby project maintained in my spare time, I may not always be able to provide support to third parties. I'll help if I can, but there are no guarantees. Issues and pull requests may go unanswered. Use it as-is, at your own risk.

# 🗂️ Mass Renamer 2.3

**Mass Renamer** is a Linux application developed in Python with a `Qt6` interface, which allows you to rename multiple files quickly, safely, and in an organized manner. It supports undoing the most recent renaming even if the app was closed or crashed, adding extensions to filenames, protection from accidental file or folder overscription and a multilingual interface (🇧🇷 Portuguese and 🇺🇸 English).

### 🚀 Installation and usage

Mass Renamer is made available in AppImage, which can run, theoretically, on any Linux distro.
On Ubuntu you may need to install the `libfuse2t64` package:
```
sudo apt install libfuse2t64
```
1. Run the ".appimage".
2. Select the folder where the files to be renamed are located.
3. Click "Load names" to load the names of all files in the selected folder or enter the original names manually in the "Original names" field.
4. Enter the new names in the "New names" field.
5. Click on "Rename".

NOTE: The file whose original name is on line "1" of the "Original names" field will be renamed to the name that is on line "1" of the "New names" field, and so on.
